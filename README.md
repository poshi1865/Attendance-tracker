This is a program to track attendance for a class. This can
be used by teachers to automate most of the work that comes with
monitoring attendance manually.

You can view your classes'attendance in the form of a table anytime,
or you can view a particular student's attendance in detail and know
how many classes he/she has to attend to get his attendance back on
track.

If you are using this program for the first time, you can press 4 in
the menu to create a new record for your class.

This record will then be used for taking attendance, searching for a
student through their USN, and calculating other relevant details.

Please note that your previous class record will be overwritten if
you decide to create a new record.

Also note that the total classes which have been held will be updated
everytime you take attendance.

Thank you for using our program!
